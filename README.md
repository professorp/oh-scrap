You probably think this repo violates some aspect of the "terms of usage", of some product you own, that your lawyers cooked up.

I got news for you, all code in this repo is for education purposes only. I am not liable if any of this repo's code is used in other projects/app/hacks in any way(piracy?).

If you have any problems, send me a message, I will happily take down the code you're conflicted with(make a "remove" commit).

Thank you for reading this.
